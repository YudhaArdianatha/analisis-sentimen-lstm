# Sentiment Analysis of Google Play Store App Reviews Using LSTM

This project implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**-based sentiment analysis model to classify app reviews from the Google Play Store into three categories: **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral**.  
The application is built with **Flask** as a web interface and supports direct text input, Excel file uploads, and fetching reviews directly from the Google Play Store.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

In today's digital era, user reviews of mobile applications are an important source of information for evaluation and development.  
However, the large volume of reviews, informal language, and unstructured sentences make manual analysis challenging.  
This project leverages LSTM to analyze Indonesian-language reviews, achieving an accuracy of **87.21%**.

**Key Features:**

- **Single text input** for quick analysis.
- **Excel file upload** with a `content` column for batch analysis.
- **Fetch Google Play Store reviews** using `google-play-scraper`.
- **Visualization** in the form of pie charts and word clouds.
- **Export analysis results** to Excel.

       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
     - Windows:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Ensure the model/ folder contains:**
   - `best_lstm_modelV2.h5`
   - `tokenizer_lstmV2.pickle`
   - `label_encoder_lstmV2.pickle`
5. **Run the application**
